Remember services like [Bitly] and [TinyURL]? Yeah, they still exist,
shortening your URLs for you, they've been around for a long time too.

Bitly founded in 2008 and TinyURL founded in 2002 üò±

In this post I'm detailing how I made my own Bitly with Now.sh.

You can make your own one too as I'm about to detail the process here,
or you can **[TL;DR]** for the video.

What you need:

- Node (to run the now CLI)
- The [now CLI]
- [ZEIT.co account]
- [GitHub account] (not essential)
- Yor own domain (not essential)

## Examples, why would I use a short URL?

I use short URLs for sharing my content, if you take a look at the
blog URL is quite long and not something you can reel off quickly to
someone.

There's a talk I did on Gatsby "Build-time and Client Run-time Data
Fetching in Gatsby" the URL for it is:

- https://gatsby-build-and-run-time-data-fetching-talk.now.sh

With a short URL I can condense it down a bit:

- https://ss10.dev/gatsby-data-fetching

Not massively shorter, and granted the original URL has no place being
that long!

Other examples could be the Build a Gatsby Blog from Scratch guide I
did at the end of last year:

- Full URL https://thelocalhost.blog/2019/10/31/build-an-mdx-blog
- Short URL https://ss10.dev/bab-guide

Or if you have a crazy URL no one is going to be able to recite from
memory like my YouTube channel URL:

- Full URL https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnngLXpLSFsKkDhFoO9Ct3w
- Short URL https://ss10.dev/youtube
- Shorter still https://ss10.dev/yt

I do have a vanity URL for my YouTube channel which is
https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottSpencePlease, but it's case sensitive.

## Get set up üõ†

If you don't have a machine set up for web development I have written
about getting set up [for Windows].

There's also a video I've made to go from scratch to Create React App
on Ubuntu 19.04.

## Do I have to use ZEIT?

No you can use Netlify as well. There's a great [Kent C Dodds example
with Netlify] that I used Netlify before moving to ZEIT.

## Here's a video detailing the process üì∫
