I'm going to go over globally styling the Gatsby Default Starter with
styled-components v5, I've done this in the [past with
styled-components v4] but there's been a change in v5 that I want to
document.

To do this I'm going to be using CodeSandbox so you can follow along
if you like.

## Install dependencies

- `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`
- `styled-components`
- `babel-plugin-styled-components`

## Configure `createGlobalStyle`

## Global fonts with `gatsby-plugin-google-fonts`
