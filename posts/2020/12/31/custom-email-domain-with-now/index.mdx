In this guide I'm going to cover the configuring of your custom domain
with Vercel's Now platform using the Now CLI.

I'll be primarily covering the steps you take after setting up an
account with an email provider, the email provider I'm using is [Zoho
Mail] if you don't use either of these services then this guide may
not be much use to you.

## What you'll need

- a super awesome custom domain
- a [Zoho Mail] account
- a [Vercel.co] account

## Set up an account

Zoho mail offer a 5 GB plan for free, so as long as you can manage
your email archiving then you are good.

## Create an admin super user

When you sign up with [Zoho Mail] you will be prompted to create a
super admin user for your zoho account and you're given the
opportunity to set up two factor authentication (2fa).

Zoho will even tell you about their authenticator app, which is only
for authenticating with Zoho. Use this is you like, I use a 2fa app
that you can use for multiple services.

## Verify you own the domain

You will be given a code to verify that you are the owner of the
domain, which you will need to add as a `TXT` entry on your domain
with the Now CLI.

The verification token will look something like this:

```bash
zoho-verification=se4567894.zmverify.zoho.eu
```

Add that to your domain DNS with the Now CLI, you can check your
domain DNS entries with the `ls` command.

```bash
# list your dns entries
now dns ls yourdomain.com
# add the zoho verification as a TXT record
now dns add yourdomain.com @ TXT zoho-verification=se4567894.zmverify.zoho.eu
```

## Add the MX records

Now to configure the `MX` records. MX records are essential to receive
emails in your domain. The MX records for your domain will look
something like this:

| Host Name | Address     | Priority |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| @ / Blank | mx.zoho.eu  | 10       |
| @ / Blank | mx2.zoho.eu | 20       |
| @ / Blank | mx3.zoho.eu | 50       |

```bash
now dns add yourdomain.com @ TXT zoho-verification=se4567894.zmverify.zoho.eu
now dns add yourdomain.com @ TXT 'v=spf1 include:zoho.eu ~all'
now dns add yourdomain.com @ MX mx.zoho.eu 10
now dns add yourdomain.com @ MX mx.zoho.eu 20
now dns add yourdomain.com @ MX mx.zoho.eu 50
```
