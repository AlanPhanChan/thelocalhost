## Install Fish shell

Linux and Windows Subsystem Linux

sudo apt -y install fish
```

macOS

## Oh My Fish (OMF)

Oh My Fish is touted as the Fishshell Framework but all I have used it
for is the extensive themes available, you can list them out in the
terminal with: `omf theme`

There's also previews available on the [OMF Themes Markdown doc].

An [extensive list] of packages available too

```bash
omf describe brew
```

```text
